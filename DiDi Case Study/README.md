   - How does conversion differ between loyalty and non-loyalty program participants?
* **Trip Insights**:
   - What is the share of completed trips made using electric vehicles (EVs)?
   - How do trip trends evolve over time (e.g., weekly growth rates)?
* **Program Effectiveness**:
   - Should the loyalty program be expanded based on its impact on passenger behavior and trip engagement?
