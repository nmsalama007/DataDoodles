# Mobile Product Page UX Analysis

In this project, I analyzed the mobile product page with the goal of identifying key areas for UX improvement. Using data-driven insights, I examined user behavior to uncover friction points that could be negatively impacting engagement and conversion rates. But to be honest there were the most people sweet people I have ever interviewed with and their feedback was that I wrote quite too much in the documentation and thats fair.

Based on these findings, Iâ€™ve prioritized 2-3 changes that could be implemented this quarter to significantly improve the user experience and boost conversion.
