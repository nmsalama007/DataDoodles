# Mobile Product Page UX Analysis

In this project, I analyzed the mobile product page with the goal of identifying key areas for UX improvement. Using data-driven insights, I examined user behavior to uncover friction points that could be negatively impacting engagement and conversion rates.

But to be honest, the interviews were with some of the most amazing and sweet people, their feedback was that I wrote a bit too much in the documentation and that's fair!

Based on these findings, Iâ€™ve prioritized 2-3 changes that could be implemented this quarter to significantly improve the user experience and boost conversion rates.

For detailed insights and recommendations, refer to the attached PDF document.
