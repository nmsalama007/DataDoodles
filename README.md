1. **[Data Science Portfolio Project: Prison Break](https://gist.github.com/nmsalama007/81a0804d36646772885f1874af0d3d3b)**

About this project
I will be working with a dataset of helicopter prison escapes that I got off Wikipedia .

We have six columns of data found on the website, which are all self-descriptive. In this project, we'll answer the following questions:

In which year did the most helicopter prison break attempts occur?
In which countries do the most attempted helicopter prison escapes occur?
We will be answering these questions step by step and visualizing the data as well, I have added explanation inside the workbook to make self explanatory and showcase my steps

Hope you enjoy!

2. **[Parisian Stay Regulations: Analyzing the Impact of Airbnb Listings on the City's Hospitality Landscape](https://gist.github.com/nmsalama007/ebc85ac3fd6b00e274829f6b06ff4b35)**

About this project
In recent years, Paris has implemented stringent regulations on short-term rentals to address concerns over housing shortages and the impact of tourism on local communities. This project delves into an in-depth analysis of Airbnb listings in Paris, aiming to uncover the tangible effects these regulations have had on the city's hospitality market. By leveraging historical data, we explore trends in host activity, pricing dynamics, and neighborhood-specific impacts. Through visualizations and statistical analyses, this study provides a comprehensive overview of how the regulatory landscape has reshaped the Airbnb ecosystem in one of the world's most visited cities. This analysis not only highlights key insights for policymakers and stakeholders but also offers a data-driven perspective on the evolving nature of urban short-term rentals.

Insights from the Graph: Average Listing Price by Accommodation in Paris
Higher Capacity Listings Command Higher Prices:

Listings that accommodate more people tend to have higher average prices per night. For instance, accommodations that can host 14 guests have the highest average price, exceeding 1000 Euros per night.
Significant Price Increase for Large Groups:

There is a noticeable jump in average listing prices for accommodations that can host 10 or more guests. This suggests a premium is placed on listings that can cater to large groups or families.
Moderate Pricing for Smaller Accommodations:

Listings that accommodate between 1 and 4 guests have relatively lower average prices, ranging from just under 100 Euros to around 200 Euros per night. This indicates a more competitive pricing strategy for smaller accommodations.
Mid-Range Accommodations (5-9 Guests):

Listings for mid-range group sizes (5-9 guests) show a gradual increase in average prices, with a significant step up for accommodations that host 7, 8, and 9 guests. Prices in this range hover between approximately 300 to 500 Euros per night.
Highest Prices for Largest Accommodations:

The highest average prices are observed in accommodations that can host 12, 13, and 14 guests, all of which are priced significantly higher than other categories. This indicates that such large-capacity listings are rare and in high demand, justifying the higher prices.
Demand for Large Accommodations:

The substantial prices for large accommodations suggest strong demand for such properties in Paris, potentially driven by larger tourist groups or events requiring more substantial lodging options.
Strategic Considerations
Market Targeting: Hosts with larger properties can capitalize on the high demand for group accommodations by maintaining or even increasing prices, given the limited competition and high average prices observed.
Investment Opportunities: Investors might consider focusing on properties that can be expanded or renovated to accommodate larger groups, tapping into the higher revenue potential of such listings.
Competitive Pricing: Smaller accommodations (1-4 guests) should focus on competitive pricing and differentiation through unique offerings or enhanced guest experiences to stand out in a more crowded segment.
These insights can help hosts, investors, and policymakers understand the pricing dynamics and demand trends in the Paris Airbnb market, aiding in strategic decision-making and market positioning.
