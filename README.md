About this project
I will be working with a dataset of helicopter prison escapes that I got off Wikipedia (The link is embedded within the word).

We have six columns of data found on the website, which are all self-descriptive. In this project, we'll answer the following questions:

In which year did the most helicopter prison break attempts occur?
In which countries do the most attempted helicopter prison escapes occur?
We will be answering these questions step by step and visualizing the data as well, I have added explanation inside the workbook to make self explanatory and showcase my steps

Hope you enjoy!
